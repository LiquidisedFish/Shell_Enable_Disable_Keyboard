## Shell_Enable_Disable_Keyboard
When the internal laptop keyboard goes defective, this shell program can be an temp fix.

Did try the i8042 controller method using the kernel command line option: 
> *i8042.nokbd*

This would permanently disable the keyboard. 

But the best way to disable grub interaction is just to disable console for grub. Itâ€™s done by removing 'console' from available terminals for GRUB. (Debian & Ubuntu)

> /etc/default/grub
> *GRUB_TERMINAL=serial*
